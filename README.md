## 🧪 How to Run the Project (Google Colab)
1. Upload the CSV file into Colab  
2. Open the notebook from `notebooks/`  
3. Update file paths if needed  
4. Run cleaning → EDA → ML → SQL sections  
5. Export results or visualizations as needed

## 📦 Dataset Used
- **customer_support_tickets.csv**  
  Includes: ticket subject, description, customer details, priority, channel, and satisfaction rating.

## 🚀 Future Enhancements
- Deploy ML model as API  
- Integrate with real-time ticketing system  
- Convert mockup into full Power BI or Tableau dashboard  
- Add sentiment analysis on ticket text
